<h3>An app to help you navigate Ottawa's public transit system.</h3>
<p>The Ottawa Bus Tracker app is used to look at bus schedules for stops, find stops near you, see the route of a bus and many other things. In the future, we will add features such as GPS tracking of busses as well as notifications for when your bus will arrive. This app was made as a final project for Harvardâ€™s CS50X course.</p>
